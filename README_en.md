# Python Introduction üêç

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using **pure Python**. The goal is to strengthen core OOP concepts through progressively more challenging examples.

## üìÅ Structure

```
Python-Introduction/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exercicios/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercicio1.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercicio2.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

> All files are organized inside the `exercicios/` folder.

## üéØ Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to **improve OOP skills** in Python by practicing concepts such as:

- Creating classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Class and instance methods
- Object composition

Each exercise increases slightly in complexity, allowing a gradual evolution in understanding object-oriented programming.

## üöÄ How to run the exercises

To run any exercise, navigate to the `exercicios/` folder and execute the desired file using the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```

> Example:
```bash
python exercicio1.py
```

‚úÖ Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or higher (recommended)
- No external libraries needed

## üìå Topics Covered

- Basic Python syntax
- Class and object structure
- Attribute and method handling
- Use of `__init__`, `self`, `__str__`, among others
- Code organization following good practices

## üìö Next Steps (Suggestions)

- Add exercises involving multiple inheritance
- Apply OOP to small practical projects (e.g., banking system, student management)
- Include automated tests with `unittest` or `pytest`
- Add a `requirements.txt` and virtual environment instructions (if external libraries are used in the future)
